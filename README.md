The purpose of this repo is to have some scripts and notes to get the mailing addresses of congress.





House Source Data:

Senate Source Data:

The ./process.sh does stuff.  Seems to work.

Note: one of the senate addresses had an extra return.  Removed by hand.

Also, this is pretty damn hacky.
