The purpose of this repo is to have some scripts and notes to get the mailing addresses of congress.

If you don't care about the process, you probably just want full.csv or house.csv or senate.csv.





House Source Data:
https://clerk.house.gov/Members/TextMailingLabel

Senate Source Data:
https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.xml

The ./process.sh does stuff.  Seems to work.

Note: one of the senate addresses had an extra return.  Removed by hand.

Also, this is pretty damn hacky.
